## MobiComp - Mobile Comparison Website

A website where you can compare specifications of mobile, side by side.

### Introduction
This project was made during my college coursework. In this project, I created a website where anyone could compare, rate and comment on phones. The specifications of the phones had to be manually entered on to the database so this website is included with a lounge area where any OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) could register themselves in and enter details of the product themselves so that it could be put up on the website for other users or customers to rate and review.

### Installation and Setup
Download the .sql file in this repository and import it on your SQL server or phpMyAdmin server on your local system or web hosting.
